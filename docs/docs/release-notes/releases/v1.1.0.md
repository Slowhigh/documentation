## :sparkles: Added features

* Storage tiering now supports any S3 V2 protocol-compatible vendor, including GCP Cloud storage, MinIO, Dell ECS, and Digitalocean object storage.
* Client reconnection performance improvements.
* Schemaverse now supports management operations via code.
* Added the ability to specify Memphis credentials values with helm values.conf file. It will disable random secret creation during deployment.
* Self-managed external K8s secrets with all Memphis credentials can be supplied during helm installation instead of randomly regenerated secrets. In this way, the credentials can be created by the admin prior to the installation and stored as apart of helm deployment.
* Client libs updates: Node.js SDK (1.0.7) Go SDK (1.0.4) Python SDK (1.0.5) .NET SDK(0.2.1)

### :bug:Fixed bugs

* DLS messages are not cleaned up on station removal - fixed
* Critical bug: Cluster crash when rebooting a broker - fixed
* "Message journey" causes UI crash - fixed

## :pensive: Known issues

* When storage capacity reaches 100%, Memphis GUI becomes unresponsive till cleaned up by at least 10%
* Slower connection establishment with the broker when connecting through localhost (port forward)
