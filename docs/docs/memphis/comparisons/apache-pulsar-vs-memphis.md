# Apache Pulsar vs Memphis

## What is Apache Pulsar?

Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed messaging system. Originally developed as a queuing system, it has been broadened in recent releases to add event streaming features. Pulsar makes use of Apache BookKeeper™ for its storage layer—a project created at Yahoo as a high-availability solution to Hadoop's HDFS NameNode (although not ultimately used for that use case). It shares properties with both Kafka and RabbitMQ. Pulsar is a largely community-led project with no enterprise-grade commercial backing today.

## **What is Memphis.dev?**

**Memphis.dev** is a next-generation alternative to traditional message brokers.

It enables building modern queue-based applications that require large volumes of streamed and enriched data, modern protocols, zero ops, up to x9 faster development, up to x46 fewer costs, and significantly lower dev time for data-oriented developers and data engineers.

Low footprint, highly resilient, cloud-native, and run on any Kubernetes, on any cloud.
