# Amazon S3

## Introduction

The common pattern of message brokers is to delete messages after passing the defined retention policy, like time/size/number of messages.\
Memphis offers a 2nd storage tier for longer, possibly infinite retention for stored messages.\
Each message that expels from the station will automatically migrate to the 2nd storage tier.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Configuring the integration

First, configure Amazon S3 at the integration center.\
It's a one-time configuration for an entire Memphis instance/cluster.

### Step 2: Enable S3 per station

S3 can be used as a remote storage tier during station creation
