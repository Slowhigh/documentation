# Architecture

## Key components

Memphis platform is comprised of three main components:

1. Memphis.\
   The broker itself which acts as the data storage layer. That is the component that stores and controls the ingested messages and their entire lifecycle management.
2. Metadata store.\
   Responsible for storing the platform metadata only, such as general information, monitoring, GUI state, and pointers to dead-letter messages. The metadata store uses Postgres.
3. REST Gateway.\
   Responsible for exposing Memphis management and data ingestion through REST requests.

## Ordering

Currently, ordering is guaranteed only while working with a single consumer group.

## Mirroring

Memphis is designed to run as a distributed cluster for a highly available and scalable system. The consensus algorithm responsible for atomicity within Memphis is called RAFT and does not require a witness or a standalom Qorum, unlike others such as Apache ZooKeeper which is widely used by projects like Kafka. RAFT is also equivalent to [Paxos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos\_\(computer\_science\)) in fault tolerance and performance.

Memphis brokers should run on different nodes to ensure data consistency and zero loss within complete broker’s reboots. To comply with RAFT requirements which are ½ cluster size + 1 an odd number of Memphis brokers shall be deployed. The minimum number of brokers is one, and the next scale would be 3, 5, and so forth.

## Delivery Guarantee

* At least once

This is achieved by the combination of published messages being persisted to the station as well as the consumer tracking delivery and acknowledgment of each message as clients receive and process them.

* [Exactly once (Idempotence)](./concepts/idempotency)
