# Stations

RabbitMQ has queues, Kafka has topics, and Memphis has stations.

In its simplest form, a station provides a powerful yet easy-to-use messaging queue for apps.

Its true power lies in offloading the business logic from the producers and consumers and embedding it inside the station.

Instead of endless amounts of producers, consumers, orchestrations, manual scaling, and scattered monitoring - just create a station.
